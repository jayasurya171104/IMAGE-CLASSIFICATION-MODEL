## DESCRIOTON OF MY PROJRCT

üîç Objective:
The primary objective of this task is to build a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify images into predefined categories. This task demonstrates your understanding of core computer vision concepts and neural network design.

üìã Task Description:
Design and implement a CNN for classifying images.

Use a well-known dataset such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST for training and testing.

Evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data using metrics like accuracy and loss.

Visualize the training process through graphs and sample predictions.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools Used:
Language: Python

Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: CIFAR-10 (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)

üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture:
Input layer matching the image shape

Multiple Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

Pooling layers for downsampling

Flatten and Dense (fully connected) layers

Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

üìä Performance Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Loss

Visualization: Training vs Validation accuracy and loss plots

Test Evaluation: Final model tested on a separate dataset to measure generalization

‚úÖ Expected Output:
A trained CNN model capable of predicting image classes.

Final test accuracy (typically around 70‚Äì80% on CIFAR-10 with basic tuning).

Graphical plots showing learning trends over epochs.

Optionally: Save the model using model.save().

üéØ Learning Outcomes:
By completing this task, you will:

Understand how CNNs extract spatial features from images.

Gain hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.

Learn how to handle and preprocess image data for machine learning tasks.

Improve your ability to analyze and tune neural network performance.

üìÅ Deliverables:
Python/Jupyter Notebook script (.py or .ipynb)

Output graph images (Accuracy & Loss)

Trained model file (optional)

Sample predictions (optional)
